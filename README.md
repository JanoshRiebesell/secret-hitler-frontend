## Usage
Secret Hitler mobile recreates the board game's experience straight from your mobile device.

This game is designed to be played by 5 to 6 people.

After launching the app, one player initiates the game by clicking the 'Create' button on the home screen. The initiator will be assigned a room number to be copied and shared with the rest of the party.

Then, the remaining 4 to 5 players may click on the 'Join' button and insert the room id to join the game. Once there are enough players to start the game, the initiator can press 'Start' to begin playing.

Each player will then be assigned their secret role and will be redirected and navigated through the rest of the game play.

Let the betrayal begin!

## Future features
The game is still in development and will shortly introduce new features and allow players to partake in a unique party game experience.
